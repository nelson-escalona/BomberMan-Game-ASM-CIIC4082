; Safe-State, don't alter:
;   What currently works with this code:
;       - Renders up to 4 sprites horizontally.
;       - Makes use of Zero Page for Tile, Player_X, Player_Y
;       - Subroutine works fine
;
;   What is missing:
;       - Only rendering horizontally once, need to add a condition
;         so that once 4 sprites have been rendered it goes to the
;         next row below and starts player_x at it's original position
